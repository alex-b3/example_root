More and more organizations adopt microservices architecture into their ecosystems.
We have created an application written in Java, which uses the JBehave and Thucydides frameworks. 
Here we are proposing a guideline which describes how to write automated tests for REST API application that includes several microservices.
Basic knowledge of Java is required, also it is better to get familiar with RestTemplate library and Maven.
This infrastructure can be used either locally or in staging and production environments and can also be integrated with Jenkins.
